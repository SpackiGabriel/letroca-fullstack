The platform enables users to register, log in, and list their available books for exchange. 
Users can browse through the available books, request exchanges, and manage their book inventory. 
The primary goal is to create a community-driven platform where book lovers can connect, share their favorite reads, and discover new titles. 
Through Letroca, users can promote sustainable practices by recycling books and fostering a culture of sharing and collaboration in reading.
